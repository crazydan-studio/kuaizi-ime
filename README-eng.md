**筷字输入法** (Kuaizi IME) is a system based on the combinatorial features of Chinese Pinyin.
It is an efficient and fast input method editor, suitable for electronic touchscreen devices.

**筷字输入法** (Kuaizi IME) abandones the traditional method of tapping on virtual keyboard keys one by one,
it instead offers a swipe input method for Pinyin, combined with the combinatorial features of Pinyin letters.
The key layout is designed to make Pinyin input more accurate and convenient.

**筷字输入法** (Kuaizi IME) provides editing support such as cursor movement
and text selection for the target editor, thereby eliminating the frustration
of being unable to accurately position inputs and text due to the small screen size of mobile devices.
This further enhances text input and editing efficiency on small-screen devices.

User-data generated by **筷字输入法** (Kuaizi IME) is stored locally.
It does not connect to the internet and will not collect nor analyze user data or behavior habits.
Furthermore, it does not support or provide predictive input nor fuzzy matching mechanisms.
To some extent, this input method editor aims to enhance the users' ability to recognize
and memorize Chinese characters and Pinyin, ensuring that the reliance on digital tools
does not lead to the gradual forgetting and eventual abandonment of
<b>「汉字」</b> (Hànzì, Chinese characters), a treasure of Chinese civilization.

## About the icon

**筷字输入法** The icon is composed of the Chinese character <b>「字」</b> (zì, character)
and the Chinese-style utensil <b>「筷子」</b> (Kuàizi, chopsticks).
This combination closely links Chinese civilization with the unique culinary culture of its people,
showcasing the long history of Chinese civilization.
It also helps to spread traditional Chinese culture to the world,
deepening global friends' understanding and appreciation of Chinese culture.
At the same time, it allows the Chinese people to have a stronger confidence in their national culture.

## Feature Highlights

- Input Pinyin via a swiping motion, with a maximum of only two swipes required for a single input.
- Built-in
  [8VIM](https://github.com/8VIM/8VIM)/[8pen](./docs/Increasing_the_Efficiency_of_Text_Input_in_the_8pen_Method.pdf)
  input mode, allowing continuous input of Pinyin, English, and numbers by drawing circles,
  providing a smooth input experience.
- All candidate characters are displayed with their complete Pinyin,
  making it easy to identify the accurate pronunciation of each character.
- Input data is stored locally; no collection or analysis of user data.
- Utilizes Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and the Viterbi algorithm for Pinyin input prediction.
- Supports only precise Pinyin input matching; does not support Pinyin predictive input or fuzzy matching mechanisms.
- Provides editing functions such as cursor movement, text selection, copy, paste, and cut.
  Additionally, supports undoing inputs submitted to the target editor for easy corrections.
- Supports left-handed and right-handed mode switching to accommodate different user habits.
- Supports basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division),
  allowing calculations while typing.
- Supports input of punctuation, emojis, and other text symbols, offering rich forms of expression.
- Supports direct input of paired punctuation marks (e.g., brackets, quotes)
  and automatically wraps selected content within them.
- Automatically adds spaces between Latin characters and Chinese characters,
  as well as between operands and operators, to standardize input formatting.
